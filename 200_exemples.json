It was an asset evaluation and integration job for Enron North America: job 0000105886. My primary strengths are: Natural gas asset acquisition and management Supporting a trading organization by providing excellent futures and derivatives execution Trading proprietary books (fixed price or otherwise)where there is a competitive reason to be in the market, i.e. transportation spreads, storage, physical presence Good customer relations\/account development Ability to focus on and analyze a wide range of problems\/opportunities Stong negotiator I know that Enron is a big, happening place and it is invaluble to have someone like you to help me sort out the opportunities. Where I am coming from is that I have to more valuble to Enron than I am to Oxy because Oxy is doing frustratingly little to leverage itself and Enron is setting every trend imaginable in leveraging itself. I appreciate any help you can provide. Thanks. Alan To: Alan_Batt@oxy.com ",

        "Body":"Additional offerings to round out your portfolio John I left a message about this last week, but wanted to follow-up with additional information for your review. We have three offerings currently available (or coming soon) that I feel would compliment the small\/mid cap and fixed income exposure you already have through Redwood, Sequoia, and Willow. Quantitative Allocation, LLC: Integrates four quantitative investment models to drive aggressive (and potentially leveraged) asset allocation decisions. Generates exposure to stock and bond markets through indexing techniques and futures transactions. Portfolio market exposures can range from +325% to -175% of net assets. This is clearly different from the largely non-leveraged stock-picker funds you already own. I would consider this to be a predominately large-cap investment (I think of it as an index fund with a brain and on steroids call me and I'll explain that comment in more detail). Juniper Crossover Fund, LLC: Managed by OrbiMed Advisors, and focused on global biotech and pharma. Up to 30% participation in private equity. This could be a way to get you some private equity exposure with a world-class manager. Tamarack International Fund, LLC: Long\/short stock-picker fund focused on the international mid-cap market. I feel this fund is very similar in style to the managers you already own, but would give you exposure to the international markets that you currently lack. This is a new fund and the first closing will probably be in June. Of course, the summaries above are for information purposes only and do not constitute an offer to sell or solicitation of an offer to buy interests in these funds. Please call me if you're interested in any of the strategies outlined above, and I'll have the appropriate offering memorandum sent to you.

        "Body":"Big news! I'm not sure if you have heard our fun news yet, but Rob and I are moving to Boston at the first of the year!! I will be working remotely for HBK while looking for something new up there. Rob is continuing his career with Fidelity, though in a much more convenient location. The only downside is he will actually have to go into the office every day! We would love to see everybody before we leave, though it may not be possible with the holidays. I'll be back in Dallas once a week in January and February, so we could plan to get together during one of those trips. But before that time, Rob and I will be with a group of friends from HBK at Martini Ranch on Thursday, December 14th right after work. I'm sure we'll be there late, given my love of martinis, so please stop by if you can. Regardless, I really want to stay in touch with my Texas friends, so make sure and send me your updated contact information if anything has changed in the last year. Please pass this on to people who I may have inadvertently missed or I did not have their current email address. Cheers, Heather Robertson P.S. By the way, our house is on the market right now, so if you know of anyone looking, please tell them about it. The address is 6815 Vivian Avenue, Dallas, 75223 and can be seen on <URL> ",

Lavorato, The $1500 that you sent to us in October, has not been credited to our account.If those funds were sent through AM TRADE INTERNATIONAL, you need to have your bank send an amendment message stating that the respective funds are intended for final credit to World Sports Exchange\/ ACCT 12307915. Most likely, those funds are sitting at the Antigua Overseas Bank. 2. Another suggestion would be to call back those funds since the beneficiary is not in receipt of payment, and resend it through the new instruction as per our website.This method is guaranteed more efficient.

Alive with flavor, it offeres black cherry, blackberry, and black raspberry fruit along with notes cedar, black pepper, tobacco, and leather. It has a great medium-weight feel and a supple texture. It is alive, vibrant, and elegant in the mouth. Not complex but super delicious. I almost don't want to give it the score it deserves because I'm afraid no one will believe me; it tastes like it cost much more and comes from a much fancier appellation. Excellent. SPEC's Score: 92+ points. (Due to the fact that only 22 cases of this 1997 are available, this item will be sold at SPEC's 2410 Smith Street Warehouse Store only.)

But industry experts say the company's woes run deeper, involving management missteps that could occur at any corporation as well as troubles rooted in the economics, politics and culture of Europe.<URL> Finance and Investment A New Approach to Valuing Biotech Stocks Now that the U.S. faces a bioterrorist attack in the shape of anthrax, stocks of biotechnology companies are soaring. But while these companies have promising technologies, they are years away from profits. The boomlet shows, however, how hard it is to value biotech stocks. Analysts often use proxy drivers such as the number of patents or the dollar value of partnerships to value such companies, but these drivers fail to show if the companies will be able to turn their research into marketable products. Research by Karl Ulrich, a Wharton professor of operations and information management, and other colleagues offers insights into a new approach to value biotech companies. Hint: Look at how the company's drug discovery process is organized.<URL> Finance and Investment James J. Cramer Finds Truth and Inspiration in the Shopping Habits of Americans When James J.

Thomas, CFO of Citigroup, described the near-term economic outlook to an audience at the Wharton Finance Conference on Oct. 12. But longer-term, Thomson was more optimistic, predicting that increased government spending and\/or tax cuts would stimulate a recovery. He also suggested that the financial markets must learn to adapt to the reality of \"continued minor terrorism.\"<URL> Managing Technology An Insider's Scathing Look at E-commerce Excesses As a manager in an Old Economy firm, Brian Ross naturally felt defensive when proselytizers of the New Economy preached that the Internet \"had changed everything\" and folks (like him) who \"just didn't get it\" would soon be by-passed by competitors who did.

It's beautifully made, and packed with enough flavor to develop with cellaring. Drink now through 2008. \"Have your own tasting notes?

Full-bodied and incredibly classy, with a solid palate and ultrafine tannins. Goes on and on. One of the most underrated producers in the business. Merlot and Cabernet Sauvignon. Best after 2006\" The Wine Spectator \"The Seraselva is 60% Merlot and 40% Cabernet Sauvignon. The wine is a full-bodied with good tannic structure. Seraselva displays aromas of cedar, cigar-box, and deep, dark fruit. The wine has powerful flavors of black currant, licorice and with strong impressions of oak. The extracted and tannic structure of this wine could benefit from bottle aging.The Seraselva was scored 93 Points by the Wine Spectator last year,this is clearly a far superior wine.\" 95+ Points Gary Vaynerchuk (June 8, 2001)Have your own tasting notes?

The CFTC says over a five-month period during 1996, Clay Krhovjak, of Bellville, Texas, a= nd Paul Cochran, of Houston, engaged in a fraudulent trading scheme to allo= cate profitable trades belonging to Coastal to accounts controlled by other= unnamed scheme participants. =09 =09 The two men were assistant vice presidents at Coastal'scommodity futures trading desk in Houstonand were responsible for placing energy futures or= ders for Coastal with floor personnel at the New York Mercantile Exchange, the CFTC said. The CFTC said the men conducted their scheme through Refin= ed Energy, Inc. of Red Bank, New Jersey, which was one of the NYMEX floor o= perations used by Coastal. \"This allocation scheme ensured Cochran, Krhov= jakand other participants risk-free personal profits,\" according to the CFT= C complaint. The CFTC also alleges the two men defrauded Coastal by tradi= ng ahead of the firm's futures trades, in that they used advance knowledge of Coastal trades to obtain profits illegally for themselves and others. A public hearing will be held at a later date to determine if the allegatio= ns are true and if so, what sanctions are appropriate, the CFTC said. Sep= arately, in September 2001, Krhovjakand Cochran each pleaded guilty to one count of conspiracy to commit commodities fraud before the U.S. District Co= urt for the Southern District of Texas. Sentencing in that case is expected= in early 2002, the CFTC said. -By Kim Archer, Dow Jones Newswires; 202= -479-0853; Kim.Archer@dowjones.com =09 ",

        "Body":"U.S. Soccer Presents \"Center Circle\" (October 2001, Inaugural Issue) In this Inaugural Issue of U.S. Soccer's new monthly fan newsletter e-zine, you'll find the items listed below. Some will return next month, others will be entirely fresh for November. 1) Armchair Midfielder (MLS Playoffs) 2) Word Association (w\/ MNT defender Jeff Agoos) 3) At the Movies (w\/ U-17 MNT defenders Chris Lancos and Gray Griffin) 4) Queries and Anecdotes (w\/ WNT midfielder Julie Foudy) 5) Big Woman on Campus (w\/ WNT\/U-21 WNT midfielder Aleisha Cramer) 6) Superstar!!! (w\/ WNT forward Tiffeny Milbrett) 7) Mark That Calendar (2001 Lamar Hunt U.S. Open Cup) 8) Point-Counterpoint (w\/ journalists Jere Longman and Steve Davis) 9) From the Bleachers (w\/ PHILIPS chant contest winner Randal Bird) 10) \"You Don't Know Jack (Marshall)\" (U.S. Open Cup history) 1) ARMCHAIR MIDFIELDER A monthly column about the State of Soccer, from the world game to Team America to pro soccer in the good &#8216;ole U-S-of-A, all with a healthy dose of cynicism. This month, the Armchair Midfielder will handicap the second round of the MLS playoffs and go on record with a pick for MLS Cup 2001 champion. So the defending champs are gone, and with them went their blase brand of defensive-minded soccer. MLS Cup will not be \"Goin' to Kansas City\" this year. And let's face it, we as soccer fans are all better off with the Wizards watching the final from an Irish pub in downtown K.C. Instead, we get a classic (okay, the word is a bit of a leap considering MLS is just a toddler) match-up between the Galaxy and the Fire. Here are two teams that have been good every year that they've been in MLS. Sure, they've each had their ups and downs, but you can always count on them to play attractive soccer. Continue: <URL> \"BEHIND CLOSED DOORS\" A section that will let you get to know the real personalities of your favorite Men's, Women's and Youth National team players through various funny and unique first-person accounts. In this issue, you'll find: 2) \"WORD ASSOCIATION\" (w\/ Jeff Agoos) Jeff Agoos may or may not need some sort of therapy. Regardless, with 25 prompts on topics both easy and tough, we play psychiatrist to get a candid look inside the mind of San Jose Earthquakes star Jeff Agoos, one of the most accomplished defenders and one of the most enduring personalities in U.S. Soccer history. \"Goose\" has been a member of the U.S. Men's National Team program since 1985 and has the rare distinction of being the only men's player to compete on every major national team level offered by U.S. Soccer (U-15, U-17, U-20, Olympic, full Men's National Team and that's right, the game everyone loves to ignore Futsal). The 33-year-old veteran has won championships both at the college (at the Univ. of Virginia) and pro (D.C. United of MLS) levels and is currently being counted on to help the U.S. Men qualify for the 2002 World Cup after missing out on chances to play in both the 1994 and 1998 World Cups. Prompt Response Dallas Home Music Rock n' roll Pony Tail Goose Style Armani Bora Milutinovic [MNT coach 1991-95] Teacher Steve Sampson [MNT coach 1995-98] No comment Bruce Arena [current MNT coach] Winner, motivator Continue: <URL> 3) \"AT THE MOVIES\" (w\/ U-17s Chris Lancos and Gray Griffin) What to do between meals and training and meals and light out? For any and all of those that have been called into a U.S. National Team camp, the answer is: see a movie. Perhaps no U.S. team sees more movies than those precocious teenagers from the U.S. Under-17 Men's National team. Strip mall cinema connoisseurs Chris Lancos and Gray Griffin recount summer blockbuster \"American Pie 2\", a shining beacon of good taste and sophisticated humor. It should be noted that both players were accompanied by an adult (most likely U-17 MNT head coach John Ellinger or goalkeeper coach Peter Mellor) to the viewing of the aforementioned movie. Chris Lancos, U.S. U-17 defender and native of Belford, N.J.: \"Gotta admit it &#8211; I'm a big fan of the first American Pie. Great movie &#8211; one of the funniest I have seen in a while. So I went in with high hopes for the second one... Gray Griffin, U.S. U-17 captain\/defender and native of Huntersville, N.C.: \"GREAT MOVIE! Without a doubt, you need to see it if you haven't seen it. I've seen it twice... Continue: <URL> 4) \"QUERIES AND ANECDOTES\" (w\/ Julie Foudy) Off-the-wall Questions and Answers, Queries and Anecdotes from the veteran U.S. WNT captain and jokester herself Center Circle: Who's your favorite superhero and why? Julie Foudy: \"It has to be Spiderman. Simply because I love the Spiderman theme song and I like to think I move across the field with the speed, agility and grace of a spider. Then I woke up.\" CC: What's your biggest brush with greatness, meaning, who's the biggest celebrity you've met? JF: \"Aside from Mia Hamm, who doubles as my caddy for her second job, I'd have to say Socks, the White House feline. Socks was extremely hospitable and chatty, and made my White House experience very enjoyable.\" CC: If you were a cartoon character, who would you be? (And why?) JF: \"Scooby Doo, because he always gets to eat.\" CC: Is there a better city than San Diego? JF: \"If you can find me a place where the sun shines about 360 days a year and the temperature stays in the range of 65-85 degrees 12 months a year, you have blue water and sandy beaches and the greatest soccer fans in the WUSA, then maybe. But I doubt it.\" Continue: <URL> 5) \"BIG WOMAN ON CAMPUS\" (w\/ Aleisha Cramer) A monthly \"How's School?\" report from the campus of one of the many players on U.S. Youth National Teams who finds themselves cramming for exams in between U.S. training camps. This month, we get a page from the journal of BYU sophomore and Lakewood, Colo., native Aleisha Cramer, the U.S. Under-21 WNT veteran and rising star on the full U.S. Women's National Team. If you've ever been to Provo, Utah, you probably know that there is not a heck of a lot do. But after over a year at BYU, I am starting to realize that the city and surrounding area has a lot to offer you just have to be creative. Still, most of my time during the college season is spent on the soccer field, traveling to the soccer field or coming back from the soccer field. Oh yeah, our coach Jen Rockwood likes to have a lot of meetings too. Basically, most of my day is taken by soccer and studying. But despite all the time dedicated to soccer, believe it or not, I do have a social life and I'm really enjoying college. I have a great group of friends and we always have fun. The coolest thing is that we have fun just doing nothing. It's amazing that we can laugh as much as we do just hanging out. Continue: <URL> 6) \"SUPERSTAR!!!\" (w\/ Tiffeny Milbrett) A monthly feature about a U.S. Men's, Women's or Youth National Team player from the U.S. Soccer Communications Department. This month, we turn the big spotlight on all 5 feet 2 inches of superstar U.S. Women's National Team forward and WUSA Most Valuable Player Tiffeny Milbrett. \"Without Time For a Pit Stop, Forward Tiffeny Milbrett Powers Her Way to WUSA MVP Honors\" Like many young and successful professional athletes, Tiffeny Milbrett owns two cars. And like many who love their cars, they reflect the owner in many ways. The first, a jet-black 2001 Chevrolet S10 4x4 pickup truck, which Milbrett received for being named the 2000 U.S. Soccer Chevrolet Female Player of the Year. (She upgraded from a four-door. Not her style). The truck represents the ruggedness of the five-foot-two Milbrett, who despite her small stature, has scored 86 career international goals, good for sixth best in world history. It also represents the outdoors woman and adventurer that she is, a small-town Oregon girl who loves nature and travel, and who spent a good part of three years of her life in Japan playing professional soccer. Her other car is a gleaming, silver 2000 Audi S4 sports car is unique, sleek and does zero-to-60 in nothing flat. With 275 horsepower, it darts past other cars, takes curves like it was on rails and looks good doing it. It can go as fast as 165 miles an hour (Note to Oregon Highway Patrol: Tiffeny has never taken it that fast, as far as you know). Milbrett drives it like she plays, at a few gears higher than the rest, and hell-bent to get where she is going, which is usually the goal, a journey that is almost always successful. Continue: <URL> 7) \"MARK THAT CALENDAR\" (2001 Lamar Hunt U.S. Open Cup Final) A stern reminder about an upcoming U.S. Soccer event, whether you plan to check it out live and in person or on the tube. October has always been known for three things: Fall foliage, Halloween, and the abrupt cancellation of weak new TV shows like \"Emeril!\" (How bad can 22 minutes of entertainment be?) or another lame \"Seinfeld\" spinoff (Note to Michael Richards: Kramer's only funny in small doses). But for soccer fans, it's all about championship soccer. For U.S. Soccer, that championship is the 2001 Lamar Hunt U.S. Open Cup, American soccer's oldest tournament. This year's title match is a first for both the Los Angeles Galaxy and the New England Revolution when it comes to the 88-year-old annual competition, which is open to all teams (amateur or pro) affiliated with U.S. Soccer and has made its mark as a ripe ground for inter-league upsets of David vs. Goliath. Continue: <URL> 8) \"POINT-COUNTERPOINT\" (w\/ journalists Jere Longman and Steve Davis) Every month, we'll pose a question or make a statement about something in soccer that will be debated on by two individuals from the same walk of life. Be it a coach, player, general manager, the two will each give their side of the story, so to speak. In this case, we've enlisted the help of two soccer journalists. In one corner, wearing a Mia Hamm replica jersey under his shirt and blue blazer Jere Longman, who covers international sport and the Olympics for the New York Times and whose extensive coverage of the 1999 Women's World Cup turned into a book about the U.S. Women's National Team entitled \"The Girls of Summer.\" In the other corner, wearing a worn-out replica of the now infamous U.S. Men's \"denim star\" jersey Steve Davis, a general columnist who's also been covering soccer for The Dallas Morning-News for over a decade and has covered the last two Men's World Cups. This month's question: What event had a greater impact on soccer in the United States: World Cup &#8216;94 or Women's World Cup &#8216;99? Jere Longman, pro-WWC99: It is indisputable that the 1999 Women's World Cup had a greater impact on soccer in the United States than the 1994 men's World Cup. The Women's World Cup produced an American champion, and the American public loves a winner. In three weeks, without benefit of lavish pre-game shows or newspaper special sections, the Women's World Cup built a galvanizing momentum. It went from almost zero on the public radar to a consuming moment that drew over 90,000 fans to the final match against China at the Rose Bowl and attracted 40 million television viewers... Steve Davis, pro-WC94: Back in the early 1990s, soccer was like the puny kid in junior high: lots of potential, plenty of good things ahead but still the last one picked for the team and having some trouble fitting in. World Cup 1994 changed all that. It was international soccer's coming out party in the United States. A land that respects the big event, the colossal show, began to see soccer as a sport it could learn to like. For soccer fans, it was their moment in the sun. More importantly in the big picture, Americans who wouldn't know a corner kick from a corner market tuned in to see what the fuss was about. Until the United States wins a World Cup, nothing else will be more influential in elevating the sport's domestic profile. Continue: <URL> 9) \"FROM THE BLEACHERS\" (w\/ PHILIPS Chant Contest winner Randal Bird) A monthly look at the fans behind the U.S. National Teams. In this case, one special fan by the name of Randal Bird has gone and made himself part of U.S. Soccer history as the author of the contest-winning Philips\/U.S. Soccer chant that will hopefully be a part of international matches for years to come. GOALS! GOALS! GOALS! Chanting to Your Heart's Content When Philips Electronics joined U.S. Soccer in a partnership to help promote and develop the sport of soccer in the United States last June, their first order of business was launching a unique \"chant\" contest to challenge U.S. Soccer fans from all over the globe to log on to <URL> and begin chanting to their hearts content. Of course, choosing a winning chant for which hundreds of fans would eventually be asked to latch on to as their own was never going to be easy. Fans come in all different shapes and sizes. And so do stadium chants. >From the long and melodic melodies of \"We all root for the red soccer team, the red soccer team, the red soccer team\" (as sung to the lyrics of Yellow Submarine) to the less melodic but rhythmic eloquence of a European chant like \"Stand up, if you hate Man U. Stand up, if you hate Man U.\", they each have their own charm. Continue: <URL> 10) \"YOU DON'T KNOW JACK (MARSHALL)\" (U.S. Open Cup history) Think you know your U.S. Soccer trivia? Well...try us. We'll see how far back your knowledge of Team USA and U.S. Soccer extends. And who the heck is Jack Marshall? Even the trivia buffs in the U.S. Soccer Communications Department would be hard pressed to tell you that one Jack Marshall received his one and only cap way back in 1926. Okay, that was pretty much impossible. They get easier. We give you four questions each month, 1 to 4, easy to hard. Answer #1 correctly, and it's safe to assume you haven't been stuck in a cave for the last five years. Answer #2 correctly, and you already know more about soccer than any anchor from \"SportsCenter\". Answer #3 correctly, you're probably pretty proud of yourself. Don't be. Try Question #4. If you answered #4 correctly, you are either N.Y. Daily News soccer writer Michael Lewis or you own a U.S. Soccer Media Guide. This month's trivia has to do with the annual, upset-friendly, \"knock-out\" tournament known as the Lamar Hunt U.S. Open Cup. Questions: Q1: (Difficulty level 1 of 4) True or False: The U.S. Open Cup is the oldest soccer competition in the United States. Q2: (2 of 4) Who was the first MLS team to win the U.S. Open Cup? Q3: (3 of 4) Who are the two United Soccer Leagues to team to win the U.S. Open Cup in the 90's, and what year did each team take the crown? Q4: (4 of 4) What year did the Open Cup competition not have an outright winner?

The effect of President Bush's recently proposed economic stimulus package is difficult to gauge given that consumer and corporate spending remain so unpredictable. Experts agree, however, that the timing of the stimulus will have a major impact on its success or failure.<URL> Finance and Investment Japan's Economic Outlook Remains Gloomy But Opportunities Exist for Investors Japan's stock market and its economy have been in a dismal state since the beginning of the 1990s. The Sept. 11 terrorist attacks in New York and Washington made matters worse, pushing the country into what analysts say is Japan's fourth recession in a decade. But Wharton faculty and outside market analysts add that some sectors of the Japanese economy should be attractive for long-term investors.<URL> Strategic Management What Webvan Could Have Learned from Tesco Webvan, the ambitious online grocer, once bragged that it would set a new standard for Internet retailing. As most people now know, for all its hubris the company has turned out to be one of the dot-com economy's most spectacular failures. After burning its way through $1.2 billion in capital, it declared bankruptcy in July. But does Webvan's collapse mean that shoppers dislike buying groceries online? For a part of the answer, look across the Atlantic to a Britain-based supermarket chain called Tesco. Its online arm, Tesco.com, will probably have revenues of $420 million this year.<URL> Finance and Investment Is Behavioral Finance a Growth Industry? Can psychology really help us understand financial markets? Yes, say many academics. The subdiscipline of behavioral finance which argues that investors are not as rational as traditional theory assumes and that their biases can affect asset prices has gained ground over the past five years. Although behavioral finance attracts powerful criticism and at times is clearly been oversold it seems to be growing up. Experts at Wharton and other business schools provide some perspectives.<URL> Health Economics Prescription Drug Coverage for Seniors Faces Uncertain Future Less than a year ago, in the heat of the presidential campaign, it seemed almost certain that Medicare would undergo a major transformation that would provide prescription drug coverage to the program's 40 million seniors. But that was before an economic slowdown and the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks. Now there are new, more urgent priorities and it's unclear just when the debate over drug coverage will again get underway.<URL> Public Policy and Management Are Government Bailouts Bad Business? Even the most cold-hearted free-marketer would concede the airlines got a tough break in the two-day grounding after the terrorist attacks. No manager could have been expected to anticipate events on the scale of Sept. 11, or to set aside enough money to cover the revenue shortfalls that followed. So a government bailout is a reasonable response, right? Not necessarily, say those who have studied past examples of government bailouts.<URL> Finance and Investment The Man Who Made Wall Street Finally Gets Credit When a book is entitled The Man Who Made Wall Street, you just don''t expect the sub-title to read: Anthony J. Drexel and the Rise of Modern Finance. Yet according to author Dan Rottenberg, the much more famous J. Pierpont Morgan never made a move without consulting Drexel, a Philadelphia banker who was as publicity-shy as he was shrewd. The way Rottenberg sees it, there''s no limit to how much you can accomplish, if you don''t care who gets the credit.<URL> Links from Knowledge@Wharton Sponsors GE Capital: Sales-Leasebacks: Benefits and Challenges Today CFOs must negotiate their way through a weakened economy.

The 1999 Beaucastel Chateauneuf du Pape is a profoundly rich= concentrated, classic vin de garde. Made from 30% Grenache, 30% Mourvedr= e, 10% Syrah, 10% Counoise, and the remainder a blend of other varietals, i= t is one of the blackest, most opaque-colored Beaucastels of the last decad= e. The bouquet offers aromas of licorice, roasted meats, black cherry and blackberry fruit, and a truffle-like earthy note. Broodingly backward, for= midable endowed, powerful, and extremely tannic, it will require 8-10 years= of cellaring, and should age effortlessly for three decades or more. Fran= cois Perrin compares it to the thrilling 1990, but at this stage, it appear= s to me to be more structured and closed than the 1990 was at a similar age= In any event, it is a great wine, but readers older than 55 should think= twice before investing in such a backward vintage.\"Have your own tasting n= otes?

I= t is made from 80% Roussanne and 20% Grenache Blanc, fermented in 80% cuves= and 20% barrels, of which 10% are new, and bottled with minimal clarificat= ion. Like a top Hermitage, the Perrins subscribe to the theory (and I tend= to agree) that this is a wine to drink during its first 2-4 years of life,= or forget it for at least a decade. It takes on an oxidized mid-life cris= is between 5-10 years of age, and re-emerges as a completely different anim= al around age ten. Of course, each vintage has its own track record, but i= t is a fascinating wine to drink young, as well as an impressive one to hav= e after ten years. The light gold-colored 1999 reveals intense marmalade a= nd rose petal, honeyed richness with a touch of spice and toast. Thick and= unctuously-textured, but supported by excellent acidity, it can be drunk o= ver the next 4! -5 years, and then ignored for a decade. It will keep for 20 years.\"Have your own tasting notes?

        "Body":"Historic Lafite-Rothschild at Winebid.com Welcome to Winebid.com's newest auction, which begins closing Sunday, Dec. 30, at 9 p.m., US Eastern Time. Rarely do 19th-century wines from top producers become available. So we are pleased in this auction to offer Lafite-Rothschild 1864, 1865, 1870 and 1900. Robert M. Parker Jr. has tasted the first three and rated them between 92 and 98 pts. Michael Broadbent gave the 1900 5 stars. Taste a bit of history. Find them here: <URL> From \"perfect\" 100-point Margaux 1990 to \"perfect\" 100-point Barbaresco Sori Tildin (Gaja) 1990, this classy collection includes remarkable wines from France, Italy, Australia, California and Spain. Looking for more \"perfect\" wines? How about Harlan Estate 1997 in a magnum, Robert M. Parker Jr. 100 pts, and Chateauneuf du Pape Reserve des Celestins (Henri Bonneau) 1990, Parker 100 pts. Find them here: <URL> For \"perfect\" Bordeaux, may we suggest Beausejour (Duffau-Lagarrosse) 1990, a Robert M. Parker Jr. 100 pt wine. Wine Spectator called it \"liquid cashmere.\" We offer too Haut-Brion 1989, Parker 100 pts. Wine Spectator gave the same wine 97 pts and called it \"Superb. Great Future.\" Find them here: <URL> The greatest Shiraz ever produced in Australia? Robert M. Parker Jr. thinks Three Rivers Shiraz 1995 may be just that. He gave the wine 99 pts and called it \"A virtually perfect wine of splendid concentration, symmetry, and length (nearly a minute). This may be the greatest Shiraz produced in Australia.\" It is part of an extraordinary Three Rivers Shiraz Vertical 1989 1995.

        "Body":"Thank You! (A letter from Bruce Arena and April Heinrichs) Dear U.S. Soccer Family, As another year comes to a close, we wanted to thank each and every one of you for your support. The last 12 months have been extremely successful for both our senior National Teams and our Youth National Teams and 2002 promises to be exciting on all fronts. The U.S. Men's National Team qualified for our fourth straight World Cup, setting the stage for an exciting 2002 tournament, while the U.S. Women took their first steps toward the 2003 Women's World Cup by building on the successful launch of the WUSA this past summer. In the year ahead, our men will be focused on the Korea\/Japan World Cup, where we will square off against Portugal, South Korea and Poland in June. We are confident that with your support and the right preparation, we will have a successful tournament. For the U.S. Women, our goals are no less tangible, with preparation for the 2003 Women's World Cup qualifying becoming the focus of our activities. For our youth national teams, we saw our U-17 and U-20 Men's teams qualify for FIFA's bi-annual World Youth Championships in those age brackets. In 2002, our Under-19 Women's National Team will have the opportunity to compete in the first ever FIFA Women's World Youth Championship, with qualifying scheduled for May in Trinidad Tobago and the actual tournament set for Canada in August. This is real progress for the development of the women's game and we expect our team to successfully qualify and then compete for the title of this first-ever event. In all of the world championships, we have the opportunity to measure ourselves against the best teams in the world, and that helps to motivate our athletes. But it is the support we receive from our U.S. Soccer family and fans that inspires our players. Again, thank you for your support throughout the year and into the future. We look forward to a successful 2002. Sincerely, Bruce Arena April Heinrichs Head Coach Technical Director Head Coach Technical Director U.S. Men's National Team U.S. Women's National Team To end your membership in ussoccerfan.com, please visit <URL> and fill out an unsubscribe request.

We have so many customers in NY and the East Coast including many who worked at the World Trade Center.

Glorious aromas of crushed flowers, prunes, cedar and cigars. Full-bodied, thick and tannic, yet ripe and round, with a sleek, caressing finish. A classic Barolo that is well-priced. Made in serious quantity. Best after 2005\"Have your own tasting notes?

The 1999 Partridge is a over the top superstar. From the winemaker who brought us David Arthur, this wine may turn out to be one of the great California wines made. Huge black fruit and a dark, almost to big, mid-palate. If you are a fan of hot new California wines that ARE worth the money, this is for you.Have your own tasting notes? Post your own review of this wine on Wine Library.com! 3. #13189 Chateau Mouton Rothschild 1996 $179.99 On Sale This may be your last chance to get a first growth under $200!!!! 94 Points Robert Parker Limit one case per customer \"This estate's staff believes that the 1996 Mouton-Rothschild is very complex. I agree that among the first-growths, this wine is showing surprising forwardness and complexity in its aromatics. It possesses an exuberant, flamboyant bouquet of roasted coffee, cassis, smoky oak, and soy sauce. The impressive 1996 Mouton-Rothschild offers impressive aromas of black currants, framboise, coffee, and new saddle leather. This full-bodied, ripe, rich, concentrated, superbly balanced wine is paradoxical in the sense that the aromatics suggest a far more evolved wine than the flavors reveal. Anticipated maturity: 2007-2030. By the way, the 1996 blend consists of 72% Cabernet Sauvignon, 20% Merlot, and 8% Cabernet Franc.\"Have your own tasting notes? Post your own review of this wine on Wine Library.com! 4. #11869 Joel Gott 2000 Zinfandel $14.99 (Comes to $11.99 when you buy a case) This lush fruit driven red explodes on the palate, ripe bright raspberries and subtle cherry flavors come forth right from the beginning. Slight hints of pepper and spice intermingle on the palate. A true pleasure to drink, try this with your holiday meals. This also has a lasting finish that really rounds out this wonderful wine.

Post your own review of this wine on Wine Library.com! 5. #16067 The Fifteen Grenache VDP 2000 $11.99 On Sale 90 Points Robert Parker \"An amazing offering for $15.00, this selection of low-yielding, old-vine Grenache (yields averaged 26 hectoliters per hectare) is a 5,000 case cuvee assembled by importer Dan Kravitz. It is a dead ringer for a top-notch southern Rhone wine, even though it comes from the Mediterranean city of Roussillon. It boasts a deep ruby\/purple color as well as a big, thick nose of kirsch liqueur intermixed with pepper, spice, earth, and black fruits. There is excellent density, full body, and a whoppingly rich, concentrated finish. The 15% alcohol is well-hidden by the wine`s abundant fruit. It should evolve and drink well for 5-6 years, perhaps longer.\" Have your own tasting notes?

The Dignus is also one of the best wines to serve with a variety of different foods. If you are a fan of Bordeaux, you may find this as a great example of that type of wine for a much better price. If you have been drinking wines like Falesco, Apollonio and others then you will flip for this super steal!Have your own tasting notes? Post your own review of this wine on Wine Library.com! 9. #14223 Cosecha Particular 1996 Navarra $14.99 (Comes to $11.99 when you buy a case) A more serious version of the Dignus, this Navarra is almost to good to be true. Particular is a great producer of wine for the money and this may be his best effort to date. The 1996 Particular is massive with cherry, cassis, black currant, ruby fruit and even a hint of mint. The mid-palate is explosive and bold with an almost velvety feel to it. This wines finish is almost overwhelming with a serious explosion of cherry fruit.Have your own tasting notes?
